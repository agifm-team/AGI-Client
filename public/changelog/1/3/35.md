- env system replaced.
- The module `browser-encrypt-attachment` is `matrix-encrypt-attachment` now.
- More adaptation progress for the development of the mobile version has been made.

I'm having some small difficulties in developing the mobile version in relation to CapacitorJS. Maybe this will require me to change the module. This process will only require replacing lines of code, I won't need to rewrite everything again.

I was also trying to develop a system for saving conversation history locally, but this activity ended up being too exhausting for me on the first attempt, so I left the project part plausible. For this reason, the update that would have been `1.4.0` ended up being `1.3.35`.
