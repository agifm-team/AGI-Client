### Notes

Due to the recent events that have happened in Brazil in recent days, I had difficulty focusing on the updates of Pony House. It is not the first time that this happens, these events are all interconnected to the same events of 2023 that made me start the project of this client.

This update is more focused on fixing some issues. But in the next days, we're going back to normal routine.

The project will continue in development and I will not give up!
